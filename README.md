This project is used to clean up a database table

Project is inspired by Sami the great. Use this code to update (bulk or whatever) for mysql dbms. 

1. enter the host
2. enter the username
3. enter the password of your dbms

4. you will then have to select the database you would like to modifiy
5. then select the table with in the database
6. the columns of the selected table will appear
7. select the column(s) you want to update. The form that appears when you click the button will be exactly matching the selected columns
8. enter the old and new values for the form and click the update button.
9. The DBCleanUtil will then inform you how many of the queries successfully executed or not.
